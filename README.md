# xorer

### A simple CLI tool to encrypt/decrypt a file using XOR
Every byte of the file is XORed with 69 (_it can be changed in the code and could be everything between 1 and 255_)

It can be used to encrypt all sorts of files (e.g. photos or text files), and you can run the encrypted file through the tool again to decrypt it (_but of course you already knew that_)

I only made this tool because I thought it would help me solve a very specific CTF challenge, but it turned out my hunch was completely wrong, which rendered the tool entirely useless.
